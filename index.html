<p>Klamath County authorities are investigating the deaths of a local couple found inside their home early Sunday morning in what officials are describing as a suspected murder-suicide.</p>
<p>According to the Klamath Falls Police Department, officers responded to a welfare check at a residence on the 1400 block of Hawthorne Street at approximately 8:20 a.m. Sunday, after neighbors reported not seeing the homeowners since Halloween night. Upon entry, police discovered the bodies of <strong>Colin R. Beckum, 38</strong>, and his wife, <strong>Mollie C. Beckum, 36</strong>.</p>
<p>Detectives say there were no signs of forced entry or struggle beyond what appeared to be damage within the home consistent with a disturbance. A preliminary report from the county medical examiner indicates Mollie Beckum cause of death was head trauma, while Colin Beckum's exact cause of death is still be investigated.</p>
<p>Coworkers told investigators that Colin Beckum had been acting “strange and freaked out” in the days leading up to the incident, describing erratic behavior and periods of isolation. One neighbor, who declined to be named, said she heard “shouting and a crash” around 6:30 p.m. of October 31, but did not call police at the time.</p>
<p>Authorities confirmed that several personal recordings were recovered from inside the home, believed to have been made by Mr. Beckum in the days before his death. While the contents of those recordings have not been released, investigators said they may provide insight into his mental state and the events that led to the tragedy.</p>
<p>The Klamath Falls Police Department has not found evidence suggesting the involvement of any third party, but the case remains under active investigation. Autopsy and toxicology results are pending.</p>
<p>Anyone with additional information is urged to contact the Klamath Falls Police Department at (541) 883-5336.</p>
